# sensuser
sensuser is a QT application that serves as a workbench to train models, evaluate models, and has tools to help analyze the model. The exported models can then be used in C and C++ projects using libnoodlenet found at: https://github.com/gnaservicesinc/libnoodlenet

It was originally designed as a simple "toy" 1-layer perceptron. Then it was rebuilt as a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This is something that has been around for a long time.
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron

This allows it to perform actual image classification with photos and actually achieve very high accuracy when high-quality datasets are used with correct training values for the situation.

Despite growing in scale, it is still very much a simple and small project that is intended to stay that way. Being designed as a â€œtoy," the sensuser is designed to be small, simple to use, and simple to understand, the implementation simplistic, and easy to dig into and understand.

Usage:

Click on the button labeled "load" next to the label "Positive Examples:".

Open a folder with one or more 512x512 PNG images with the object or pattern you want to train the model to identify.

Click "Train Model."

When it is finished, you may export the model by clicking "export model."

You can import a model and do more training and/ or testing with it.

You can use exported models in C and C++ projects with libnoodlenet found at: https://github.com/gnaservicesinc/libnoodlenet

If you add a negative examples folder, you can evaluate the accuracy of the model.

The negative examples should contain one or more 512x512 PNG images that DO NOT include the object or pattern you want to train the model to identify.


You can tweak settings to suit your needs.

Note:

Be careful with the number of hidden neurons; you can make the RAM requirements skyrocket into the hundreds of GB really easily with it; keep it low. The default is 128, which works well on my system with 64gb of RAM.
